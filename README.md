# SubredditParser
First iteration of my Subreddit image downloader!
 First iteration of my subreddit parser! Prompts user to add subreddits to download images from and your devices height and width. Then generates a HTML page with downloadable images of the pictures found on the subreddit @ the time the script is run! Generates a maximum of 100 images, from any amount of subreddits (you can chain multiple!)
