# SubredditParser
First iteration of my Subreddit image downloader!
Prompts user to add subreddits to download images from and your devices height and width. Then generates a HTML page with downloadable images of the pictures found on the subreddit @ the time the script is run! Generates a maximum of 100 images, from any amount of subreddits (you can chain multiple!).

The best way to use this is to open up a new chrome window, and in your browser click f12 (for debug console). Then navigate to console, and copy & paste the script. It will prompt you to type in subreddits to download from, and after you have entered them type a '.' !
After, you will be prompted to type in your screens height & width (in pixels, i.e: 1920 & 1080). Then your custom reddit image page will be created! You can click on any of these images to download the original source image at its original aspect ratio.

Try not to break this please! I created this project as I wanted to learn a bit about javascript. Any suggestions are welcome! I still have much to learn!
