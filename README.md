# SubredditParser
First iteration of my Subreddit image downloader!

This subreddit parser is to be used in the console of any modern browser. This was made for Chrome, so I suggest using it there.

This program should be copy pasted into the console in a new tab window to be run. A window will pop prompting the user to select subreddits to download from. This can be specified by the subreddits URL tag. Chain as many subreddits you want! You can make some pretty nice galleries with this script and the right subreddits.

A page will be generated by the JS code and every image on that subreddit will be downloaded (top 100 images from the time the code was run.) 

Click any of the images displayed to download them at their HIGHEST resolution! I created this mainly to get new wallpapers :) 

Enjoy, and thank you for taking the time to read this!
